>    - Use langgraph-bigtool's retrieval system to find relevant tools
>    - Example:
>      ```python
>      from langchain_mcp_adapters import load_mcp_tools
>      from langgraph_bigtool import create_agent
>      # Load MCP tools
>      tools = load_mcp_tools(session)
>      # Create tool registry
>      tool_registry = {str(uuid.uuid4()): tool for tool in tools}
>      # Create agent with bigtool
>      agent = create_agent(llm, tool_registry)
>      ```
> 
> 2. **Universal-tool-server with Octotools**:
>    - Implement Octotools' tool cards as tools in universal-tool-server
>    - Use Octotools' planning mechanism to determine which tools to call
>    - Execute the tools via universal-tool-server's REST API
>    - This combines Octotools' reasoning with universal-tool-server's deployment flexibility
> 
> Overall, it seems the industry is moving toward standardized REST APIs for tool deployment (universal-tool-server) while maintaining compatibility with MCP when needed. The choice between MCP and universal-tool-server depends on deployment requirements, with universal-tool-server being more web-friendly while MCP may offer richer integration with certain AI systems.
> 
> For the tool overload problem, both langgraph-bigtool and Octotools offer complementary approaches - langgraph-bigtool focuses on retrieval of relevant tools, while Octotools focuses on planning and optimization of tool usage. A hybrid approach that combines retrieval with planning would likely be most effective.


# Integrating MCP Servers and Clients: A Comprehensive Recommendation

After analyzing the repositories you shared, I'll provide a detailed comparison of approaches for implementing MCP servers and clients, contrasting MCP with the Universal Tool Server approach, and explaining how to address the tool overload problem.

## Comparing MCP vs. Universal Tool Server

### MCP (Model Context Protocol)

MCP is designed specifically for AI model-tool integration, popularized by Anthropic's Claude. It provides:

**Pros:**
- Native integration with Claude and supporting ecosystems
- Real-time, stateful tool interactions
- Multiple transport protocols (stdio, SSE)
- Standardized protocol for model-tool communication

**Cons:**
- Requires persistent connections (challenging for web deployments)
- Authentication not as robust in the core protocol
- Less seamless for RESTful web API patterns

### Universal Tool Server

Universal Tool Server provides a standardized REST API for deploying LangChain tools:

**Pros:**
- Stateless web deployment (easier scaling/load balancing)
- Simple REST API familiar to web developers
- Built-in authentication system
- Easy integration with web services
- Can optionally support MCP SSE protocol

**Cons:**
- Additional abstraction layer compared to direct MCP
- Might not have all MCP-specific features

## Recommended Approaches

### For Server Implementation:

**Option 1: Universal Tool Server (Recommended for Most Cases)**
```python
from universal_tool_server import Server

# Support both REST API and MCP
app = Server(enable_mcp=True)

@app.add_tool()
async def my_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Tool description."""
    return f"Processed {param}"
```

**Option 2: Pure MCP Server (If targeting MCP ecosystems)**
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

mcp = FastMCP("YourServerName")

@mcp.tool()
async def my_tool(param: str) -> str:
    """Tool description."""
    return f"Processed {param}"

if __name__ == "__main__":
    mcp.run(transport="stdio")  # or "sse"
```

### For Client Implementation:

**Option 1: LangChain MCP Adapters (With LangGraph)**
```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

# Connect to multiple MCP servers
client_config = {
    "sequential-thinking": {
        "command": "npx",
        "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"],
        "transport": "stdio"
    },
    "tavily": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/sse",
        "transport": "sse"
    }
}

async with MultiServerMCPClient(client_config) as client:
    # Get all tools from all servers
    tools = client.get_tools()
    
    # Create a ReAct agent with these tools
    model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")
    agent = create_react_agent(model, tools)
    
    # Use the agent
    result = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": "Analyze the market trends for AI"})
```

**Option 2: Universal Tool Client (For Universal Tool Server)**
```python
from universal_tool_client import get_async_client
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent

# Connect to the tool server
client = get_async_client(
    url="http://localhost:8000", 
    headers={"Authorization": "your-api-key"}
)

# Get tools and use with LangGraph
tools = await client.tools.as_langchain_tools()
agent = create_react_agent(model, tools)
```

## Solving The Tool Overload Problem

Too many tools can cause function call failures in LLMs. Here are two solutions:

### 1. LangGraph-BigTool Approach

Ideal for **large collections of diverse tools** where dynamic selection is needed:

```python
import uuid
from langchain_mcp_adapters import load_mcp_tools
from langgraph_bigtool import create_agent
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore
from langchain.embeddings import init_embeddings

# Step 1: Create tool registry from MCP tools
async with mcp_client as client:
    tools = await load_mcp_tools(client.session)
    tool_registry = {str(uuid.uuid4()): tool for tool in tools}

# Step 2: Index tools in vector store
embeddings = init_embeddings("openai:text-embedding-3-small")
store = InMemoryStore(
    index={
        "embed": embeddings,
        "dims": 1536,
        "fields": ["description"],
    }
)

# Step 3: Store tool descriptions for retrieval
for tool_id, tool in tool_registry.items():
    store.put(
        ("tools",),
        tool_id,
        {"description": f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}"},
    )

# Step 4: Create agent with tool retrieval capability
agent = create_agent(llm, tool_registry).compile(store=store)
```

This approach:
- Stores tools in a vector database
- Uses semantic search to retrieve relevant tools
- Only presents a subset of tools to the LLM at a time
- Works well when tools are functionally diverse

### 2. OctoTools Approach

Ideal for **complex reasoning across domains** with task-specific optimization:

OctoTools uses:
- **Tool Cards**: Standardized metadata for tool functionality
- **Planner**: Both high-level and low-level planning
- **Task-specific Toolset Optimization**: Learns which tool subsets work best for specific tasks

Integration example:
```python
# This is conceptual, as OctoTools doesn't have a public API documented in the repository
from octotools import OctoTools
from universal_tool_client import get_async_client

# Get tools from universal tool server
client = get_async_client(url="http://localhost:8000")
tools = await client.tools.as_langchain_tools()

# Create OctoTools instance with these tools
octo = OctoTools(tools=tools)

# Let OctoTools handle planning and tool selection
response = await octo.process_query("Analyze the market impact of the latest Fed announcement")
```

## Hybrid Implementation Recommendation

For the most robust solution, I recommend a **hybrid approach**:

1. **Use Universal Tool Server with MCP SSE enabled**:
   - Provides flexible deployment options (REST API + MCP)
   - Built-in authentication
   - Works with both web clients and MCP clients

2. **Client-side integration with LangGraph-BigTool**:
   - Handle tool selection/retrieval to avoid overwhelming the LLM
   - Store tools in a vector database for semantic search
   - Present only relevant tools for each task

3. **Incorporate planning insights from OctoTools**:
   - Add a planning phase before tool selection
   - Implement high-level and low-level planning for complex tasks
   - Consider task-specific tool optimization

## Example Implementation Flow

```python
# Universal Tool Server with MCP support
# server.py
from universal_tool_server import Server

app = Server(enable_mcp=True)

@app.add_tool()
async def tool1(param: str) -> str:
    """Tool 1 description."""
    return f"Tool 1 output for {param}"

# Add dozens more tools...
```

```python
# Client with LangGraph BigTool
# client.py
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langgraph_bigtool import create_agent
from langgraph.store.memory import InMemoryStore

# Connect to tool server
client_config = {
    "tool_server": {
        "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/sse",
        "transport": "sse"
    }
}

# Create vector store for tool retrieval
store = InMemoryStore(index={"embed": embeddings, "dims": 1536})

# Index all tools for retrieval
async with MultiServerMCPClient(client_config) as client:
    tools = client.get_tools()
    tool_registry = {str(uuid.uuid4()): tool for tool in tools}
    
    for tool_id, tool in tool_registry.items():
        store.put(
            ("tools",),
            tool_id,
            {"description": f"{tool.name}: {tool.description}"},
        )
    
    # Create agent with BigTool for tool retrieval
    agent = create_agent(llm, tool_registry).compile(store=store)
    
    # Use the agent with retrieved subset of tools
    result = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": "Your task here"})
```

This approach combines the best of both worlds - Universal Tool Server's deployment flexibility with LangGraph-BigTool's solution to the tool overload problem.
