*Thinking...*

> The user has a local FastAPI server and wants to create a new Python project that functions as an MCP (Multi-Cloud Proxy) server with the same routes as their existing FastAPI server. They want to avoid manually recreating all the routes and are asking if they can somehow instantiate a FastAPI app using the OpenAPI JSON specification from their existing server.
> 
> Let me break down what I understand and what solutions might work:
> 
> 1. They have an existing FastAPI server running locally
> 2. They want to create a new, separate Python project that will:
>    - Have all the same routes as their original FastAPI server
>    - Function as an MCP server (using fastapimcp)
> 3. They want to avoid manually recreating all the routes in the new project
> 4. They're asking if they can use the OpenAPI JSON from their existing server to automatically create the new server with the same routes
> 
> For context, FastAPI automatically generates an OpenAPI (formerly Swagger) specification at `/openapi.json` which describes all routes, parameters, request bodies, responses, etc.
> 
> Here are some approaches that might work:
> 
> ### Option 1: Use FastAPI's mount feature
> 
> FastAPI allows you to mount one FastAPI application inside another one, at a specific path prefix. This means you could:
> 
> 1. Import your original FastAPI app into your new project
> 2. Create a new FastAPI app for the MCP server
> 3. Mount the original app into the new one
> 
> ```python
> from fastapi import FastAPI
> from original_project.main import app as original_app
> 
> mcp_app = FastAPI()
> mcp_app.mount("/", original_app)
> 
> # Add MCP-specific configuration to mcp_app
> ```
> 
> ### Option 2: Generate a client from OpenAPI and create proxies
> 
> You could:
> 1. Get the OpenAPI specification from your original FastAPI app (typically at `/openapi.json`)
> 2. Use a tool like `openapi-python-client` to generate a client library
> 3. Create proxy endpoints in your new FastAPI app that call the original app's endpoints through the generated client
> 
> ### Option 3: Parse OpenAPI and dynamically create routes
> 
> You could:
> 1. Fetch the OpenAPI spec from your existing API
> 2. Parse it
> 3. Dynamically create FastAPI routes that forward requests to the original API
> 
> This is more complex but allows for more customization.
> 
> ### Option 4: Use a reverse proxy
> 
> Instead of recreating the API, you could use a reverse proxy library to forward requests from your MCP server to your original FastAPI server.
> 
> Let me provide a more detailed implementation for Option 3, which seems closest to what the user is asking for. This approach would involve parsing the OpenAPI specification and automatically creating routes in the new FastAPI application that mirror the original API:
> 
> ```python
> import json
> import httpx
> from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response
> from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
> import inspect
> 
> # Create a new FastAPI app for the MCP server
> mcp_app = FastAPI()
> 
> # Fetch the OpenAPI specification from the original FastAPI server
> async def get_openapi_spec(url="http://localhost:8000/openapi.json"):
>     async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
>         response = await client.get(url)

> Let me think a bit more about what the user is asking. They specifically mention using the "fastapimcp" project to turn their API into an MCP server. I'm not familiar with a specific project called "fastapimcp" - this might be an internal or custom library they're using. However, if we're talking about creating a Multi-Cloud Proxy server, then what they probably want is to have their API available across multiple cloud environments or regions.
> 
> If that's the case, the best approach might be to have the MCP server act as a proxy to the original FastAPI server, while maintaining the same API contract.
> 
> Let me also note that generating a FastAPI app directly from an OpenAPI specification is not a built-in feature of FastAPI. However, there are tools like `openapi-python-client` that can generate client libraries from OpenAPI specs, which could then be used to implement the proxy functionality.

> Let me look at another approach that might better fit what the user is asking for.

You can create a proxy FastAPI application that mirrors your existing FastAPI server's routes by using the OpenAPI schema. Here's how to do it:

```python
import httpx
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Response, HTTPException

# Create a new FastAPI app for the MCP server
app = FastAPI(title="MCP Server")

# Original FastAPI server URL
ORIGINAL_API_URL = "http://localhost:8000"  # Adjust as needed

# Create a route handler that proxies requests to the original server
def create_route_handler(path: str, method: str):
    async def route_handler(request: Request):
        # Get request body if needed
        body = await request.body() if method.lower() in ["post", "put", "patch"] else None
        
        # Build target URL with query parameters
        query_params = str(request.url.query)
        query_string = f"?{query_params}" if query_params else ""
        target_url = f"{ORIGINAL_API_URL}{path}{query_string}"
        
        # Forward headers (excluding host)
        headers = dict(request.headers)
        if "host" in headers:
            del headers["host"]
        
        # Forward the request to the original server
        async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
            try:
                response = await client.request(
                    method=method.upper(),
                    url=target_url,
                    headers=headers,
                    content=body
                )
                
                # Return the response from the original server
                return Response(
                    content=response.content,
                    status_code=response.status_code,
                    headers=dict(response.headers)
                )
            except httpx.HTTPError as e:
                raise HTTPException(status_code=500, detail=f"Proxy request failed: {str(e)}")
    
    return route_handler

# Register routes based on OpenAPI schema at startup
@app.on_event("startup")
async def setup_routes():
    # Fetch OpenAPI schema from original server
    async with httpx.AsyncClient() as client:
        response = await client.get(f"{ORIGINAL_API_URL}/openapi.json")
        openapi_schema = response.json()
    
    # Create routes based on the schema
    for path, path_item in openapi_schema.get("paths", {}).items():
        for method, operation in path_item.items():
            if method.lower() in ["get", "post", "put", "delete", "patch", "options", "head"]:
                # Create a handler for this route
                handler = create_route_handler(path, method)
                
                # Set handler name for better debugging
                operation_id = operation.get("operationId", f"{method}_{path.replace('/', '_')}")
                handler.__name__ = operation_id
                
                # Register the route with our app
                app.add_api_route(
                    path=path,
                    endpoint=handler,
                    methods=[method.upper()],
                    summary=operation.get("summary", ""),
                    description=operation.get("description", ""),
                    tags=operation.get("tags", [])
                )
```

To use this:

1. Install the required dependencies: `pip install fastapi httpx uvicorn`
2. Save this code in a new project (e.g., `mcp_server.py`)
3. Run it with: `uvicorn mcp_server:app --port 8001` (using a different port than your original server)
4. After this is running, you can integrate with fastapimcp to turn it into a full MCP server

This approach avoids having to manually recreate all your routes by:
1. Fetching the OpenAPI schema from your original FastAPI server
2. Dynamically creating proxy routes that match the original API
3. Forwarding all requests to your original server

Each registered route will have the same path, method, and documentation as your original FastAPI server.
