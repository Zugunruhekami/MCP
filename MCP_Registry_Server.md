> ```
> 
> ### 2. Mount Your Python-based MCP Servers
> 
> For your existing FastMCP servers (created from FastAPI/OpenAPI), you can mount them directly:
> 
> ```python
> # OpenAPI-derived MCP servers
> weather_api_mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(weather_openapi_spec, client=weather_http_client)
> news_api_mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(news_openapi_spec, client=news_http_client)
> 
> # Mount them with prefixes
> composite_mcp.mount("weather", weather_api_mcp)
> composite_mcp.mount("news", news_api_mcp)
> ```
> 
> ### 3. Mount Non-Python MCP Servers (like Node.js ones)
> 
> For servers like the Sequential Thinking server (Node.js), you'd need to use the proxy approach since you can't directly mount them. The `FastMCP.from_client` method allows you to create a proxy that connects to an existing MCP server:
> 
> ```python
> from fastmcp import Client, FastMCP
> from fastmcp.client.transports import PythonStdioTransport, SSETransport
> 
> # Create a client that connects to the Sequential Thinking server
> sequential_thinking_client = Client(
>     transport=PythonStdioTransport(
>         command="npx",
>         args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
>     )
> )
> 
> # Create a proxy server
> sequential_thinking_proxy = FastMCP.from_client(
>     sequential_thinking_client,
>     name="Sequential Thinking"
> )
> 
> # Mount the proxy
> composite_mcp.mount("thinking", sequential_thinking_proxy)
> ```
> 
> ### 4. Running the Composite Server
> 
> Once you've mounted all your servers, you can run the composite server:
> 
> ```python
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     composite_mcp.run(transport="sse", port=8000)
> ```
> 
> ### 5. Creating a Demo UI
> 
> For the UI part, you have a few options:
> 
> #### Option 1: Lightweight Frontend with FastAPI and HTML/JavaScript
> 
> Since you're already using FastAPI, you can create a simple UI by serving static files:
> 
> ```python
> from fastapi import FastAPI
> from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
> import uvicorn
> 
> app = FastAPI()
> 
> # Serve your MCP server on one endpoint
> composite_mcp.attach_to_fastapi(app, "/mcp")
> 
> # Serve static files for the UI
> app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")
> 
> @app.get("/")
> async def root():
>     return {"message": "Welcome to the MCP Hub"}
> 
> @app.get("/ui")
> async def ui():
>     # Return HTML for your UI
>     return """
>     <!DOCTYPE html>
>     <html>
>     <head>
>         <title>MCP Hub</title>
>         <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/styles.css">
>     </head>
>     <body>
>         <h1>MCP Hub</h1>
>         <div id="mcp-list">
>             <!-- List of your MCP servers -->
>         </div>
>         <script src="/static/js/app.js"></script>
>     </body>
>     </html>
>     """
> 
> if __name__ == "__main__":
>     uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
> ```
> 
> #### Option 2: Use a Pre-built Template Similar to mcp.so
> 
> You could adapt an open-source template that resembles mcp.so. This would involve creating a more sophisticated frontend, potentially with a framework like React, Vue, or Svelte.
> 
> #### Option 3: Create a Simple Dashboard with Streamlit
> 
> Streamlit offers a quick way to create interactive UIs in Python:
> 
> ```python
> import streamlit as st
> import requests
> import json
> 
> st.title("MCP Hub Dashboard")
> 
> # Display list of available MCP servers
> servers = ["weather", "news", "thinking"]
> selected_server = st.selectbox("Select MCP Server", servers)
> 
> # Display server details
> st.subheader(f"{selected_server} Server")
> 
> # Fetch tools for the selected server
> response = requests.get(f"http://localhost:8000/api/tools/{selected_server}")
> tools = response.json()
> 
> # Display tools
> st.write("Available Tools:")
> for tool in tools:
>     st.write(f"- {tool['name']}: {tool['description']}")
>     
> # Allow testing the tools
> if st.button("Test Tool"):
>     # Logic to test a selected tool
>     pass
> ```
> 
> ### 6. Integration with AI Matrix via langchain-mcp-adapters
> 
> The langchain-mcp-adapters library provides a `MultiServerMCPClient` class that seems perfect for your use case. However, since you're already consolidating your MCP servers into a single endpoint, you can simplify the integration:
> 
> ```python
> from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
> 
> # Option 1: Connect to your consolidated server
> async with MultiServerMCPClient(
>     {
>         "hub": {
>             "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/sse",
>             "transport": "sse",
>         }
>     }
> ) as client:
>     tools = client.get_tools()
>     # Use these tools with your LangGraph agent
> ```
> 
> Or, if your composite server exposes the original server tools with prefixes:
> 
> ```python
> # Option 2: Connect to multiple endpoints within your composite server
> async with MultiServerMCPClient(
>     {
>         "weather": {
>             "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/weather/sse",
>             "transport": "sse",
>         },
>         "news": {
>             "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/news/sse",
>             "transport": "sse",
>         },
>         "thinking": {
>             "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/thinking/sse",

# Creating a Unified MCP Server Hub with UI

Based on your requirements and the technologies you're using, here's how to build a central MCP server hub that combines different MCP servers with a demo UI:

## Combining MCP Servers

FastMCP's mounting feature is perfect for your use case:

```python
from fastmcp import FastMCP, Client
from fastmcp.client.transports import PythonStdioTransport, SSETransport

# Main composite server
hub = FastMCP("MCP Hub")

# 1. Mount your Python-based MCP servers (from OpenAPI)
weather_api_mcp = FastMCP.from_openapi(weather_openapi_spec, client=weather_http_client)
hub.mount("weather", weather_api_mcp)

# 2. Mount Node.js MCP servers (like Sequential Thinking) using proxies
sequential_thinking_client = Client(
    transport=PythonStdioTransport(
        command="npx",
        args=["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
    )
)
sequential_thinking_proxy = FastMCP.from_client(sequential_thinking_client, name="Sequential Thinking")
hub.mount("thinking", sequential_thinking_proxy)

# 3. Add direct tools to the hub itself if needed
@hub.tool()
def ping():
    return "Hub is alive!"
```

## Creating a Demo UI

For a UI similar to mcp.so or the MCP Registry Registry, add FastAPI with a simple web interface:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.staticfiles import StaticFiles
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
import uvicorn

app = FastAPI()

# 1. Expose your MCP server on an endpoint
hub.attach_to_fastapi(app, "/mcp")

# 2. Serve static files for the UI
app.mount("/static", StaticFiles(directory="static"), name="static")

# 3. Create a demo UI page
@app.get("/", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def ui():
    return """
    <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
    <head>
        <title>MCP Hub</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="/static/css/styles.css">
    </head>
    <body>
        <div class="container">
            <h1>MCP Hub</h1>
            <div class="server-grid">
                <!-- Dynamically populated servers -->
            </div>
        </div>
        <script src="/static/js/app.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>
    """

# 4. API endpoint to get list of available servers and tools
@app.get("/api/servers")
async def get_servers():
    # Return information about mounted servers
    return {
        "servers": [
            {"id": "weather", "name": "Weather API", "tools": ["get_forecast", "get_temperature"]},
            {"id": "thinking", "name": "Sequential Thinking", "tools": ["sequential_thinking"]}
            # Add all your servers here
        ]
    }

if __name__ == "__main__":
    uvicorn.run(app, host="0.0.0.0", port=8000)
```

## Connecting with AI Matrix

The `langchain-mcp-adapters` library's `MultiServerMCPClient` can connect to your hub:

```python
from langchain_mcp_adapters.client import MultiServerMCPClient
from langgraph.prebuilt import create_react_agent
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI

model = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o")

async with MultiServerMCPClient(
    {
        "hub": {
            "url": "http://localhost:8000/mcp/sse",
            "transport": "sse",
        }
    }
) as client:
    agent = create_react_agent(model, client.get_tools())
    response = await agent.ainvoke({"messages": "What tools are available?"})
```

This approach gives you a single, unified MCP server that hosts all your tools with proper namespacing, plus a demo UI similar to the registries you mentioned. The UI can be enhanced with JavaScript to create an interactive experience for testing tools and exploring capabilities.
