# Sequential Thinking MCP Server Integration for Planning Feature

After reviewing the Sequential Thinking MCP server and your proposal for a deep search feature, I recommend leveraging the existing Sequential Thinking MCP server rather than building a custom implementation from scratch. Here's why this approach makes sense and how to integrate it effectively with your AI matrix component.

## Why Use the Sequential Thinking MCP Server

1. **Already MCP-Compatible**: It's already built as an MCP server, making integration with your existing MCP client straightforward.

2. **Purpose-Built for Structured Reasoning**: The sequential_thinking tool is specifically designed for breaking down complex problems into manageable steps, which aligns perfectly with planning tasks.

3. **Built-in Branching and Revision**: The server already handles thought revisions and alternative reasoning paths, which are essential for sophisticated planning.

4. **Simpler Integration**: Integrating with an existing MCP server is significantly less complex than building a custom LangGraph implementation from scratch.

## Integration Architecture

Here's how to integrate the Sequential Thinking MCP server into your AI matrix component:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────┐
│           AI Matrix Component           │
├─────────────┬───────────────┬───────────┤
│             │               │           │

└─────────────┴───────┬───────┴───────────┘

│              └────────┘                 │
└─────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

## Implementation Approach

1. **Add the MCP Server Configuration**:
   Add the Sequential Thinking MCP server to your MCP client configuration:

   ```javascript
   // MCP client configuration
   const mcpConfig = {
     servers: {
       "sequential-thinking": {
         command: "npx",
         args: ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-sequential-thinking"]
       },
       // Your other MCP servers...
     }
   };
   ```

2. **Create a Planning Node in Your AI Matrix**:
   Implement a planning node that interfaces with the Sequential Thinking MCP server:

   ```javascript
   class PlanningNode {
     constructor(mcpClient) {
       this.mcpClient = mcpClient;
       this.thoughtHistory = [];
       this.currentThoughtNumber = 0;
       this.totalThoughts = 5; // Initial estimate, can be adjusted
     }

     async plan(problem) {
       // Initialize planning with first thought
       let result = await this.generateThought(problem, true);
       this.thoughtHistory.push(result.thought);
       this.currentThoughtNumber = 1;

       // Continue generating thoughts until completion
       while (result.nextThoughtNeeded) {
         // Adjust total thoughts if needed
         if (result.needsMoreThoughts) {
           this.totalThoughts += 3;
         }

         // Generate next thought (regular, revision, or branch)
         result = await this.generateThought(
           problem, 
           false,
           result.isRevision,
           result.revisesThought,
           result.branchFromThought,
           result.branchId
         );

         this.thoughtHistory.push(result.thought);
         this.currentThoughtNumber++;
       }

       // Return the complete thought process
       return {
         plan: this.thoughtHistory,
         finalThought: result.thought
       };
     }

     async generateThought(problem, isFirst, isRevision = false, revisesThought = null, 
                          branchFromThought = null, branchId = null) {
       const params = {
         thought: isFirst ? "" : this.thoughtHistory[this.currentThoughtNumber - 1],
         nextThoughtNeeded: true,
         thoughtNumber: this.currentThoughtNumber,
         totalThoughts: this.totalThoughts,
         isRevision: isRevision,
         revisesThought: revisesThought,
         branchFromThought: branchFromThought,
         branchId: branchId
       };

       // Include problem context in the message to the MCP server
       const context = `Problem to solve: ${problem}\n\nPrevious thoughts:\n` + 
                      this.thoughtHistory.map((t, i) => `Thought ${i+1}: ${t}`).join('\n');

       // Call the sequential_thinking tool
       const response = await this.mcpClient.callTool(
         "sequential-thinking", 
         "sequential_thinking",
         params,
         context
       );

       return response;
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Integrate with Your Existing AI Matrix**:
   Add the planning node to your AI matrix and connect it with your existing workflow:

   ```javascript
   class AIMatrix {
     constructor(mcpClient) {
       this.mcpClient = mcpClient;
       this.knowledgeNode = new KnowledgeNode(mcpClient);
       this.planningNode = new PlanningNode(mcpClient);
       this.actionNode = new ActionNode(mcpClient);
     }

     async process(input) {
       // First, gather knowledge
       const knowledge = await this.knowledgeNode.getRelevantKnowledge(input);
       
       // Next, create a plan using the sequential thinking MCP server
       const plan = await this.planningNode.plan(input);
       
       // Finally, execute actions based on the plan
       const result = await this.actionNode.execute(plan.finalThought, knowledge);
       
       return {
         knowledge,
         plan: plan.plan,
         result
       };
     }
   }
   ```

## Benefits of This Approach vs. Custom Deep Search Implementation

1. **Separation of Concerns**: This approach keeps planning separate from web search. If you need deep search capabilities, you could add a separate MCP server for that specific purpose.

2. **Maintainability**: Using existing MCP servers means you benefit from community updates and improvements with minimal maintenance overhead.

3. **Flexibility**: You can easily swap out or add different MCP servers as needed without rewriting your core AI matrix logic.

4. **Focus on Integration**: You can focus on how to best use the planning capabilities rather than implementing the planning mechanism itself.

## When You Might Need Deep Search Instead

If your primary goal is specifically web research rather than general planning/reasoning, consider adding the [Tavily MCP server](https://github.com/tavilydevteam/tavily-mcp) alongside the Sequential Thinking server. This would give you:

1. The structured thinking capabilities from the Sequential Thinking server
2. The web search capabilities from the Tavily server

Your AI matrix could then coordinate between these two servers to perform both planning and deep search when needed.

Would you like more detailed implementation guidance for any specific part of this integration?
